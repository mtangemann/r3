# History

## v0.3 (2024-03-28)
- Git dependencies are now automatically managed by R3
- Git dependencies do not require a `commit` key anymore. If not specified, the remote
  HEAD is used. Moreover, git dependencies might be specified by a branch or tag name.
- `find_dependents` has been added to the public API
- The commit timestamp is not stored in the job metadata anymore, but in the r3 config
  file.

BREAKING CHANGES:
- `Job.datetime` has been renamed to `Job.timestamp`
- The order of the constructor arguments for all dependency classes has been changed so
  that `destination` is always the first argument.

The repository format has been updated. Migrations scripts are provided in the
`migrations` directory.


## v0.2 (2024-03-18)
- Major refactoring of the code
- Major extension of the test suite
- CLI: Make `--repository` an option for all commands
- CLI: Remove `dev checkout` command
