# History

## v0.4 (2024-04-08)
- Jobs are now queried using MongoDB-style query documents
  - `Repository.find` expects a query document instead of a list of tags
  - Added `FindLatestDependency` and `FindAllDependency` that use the new query format
  - `QueryDependency` and `QueryAllDependency` are now deprecated
- R3 uses SQLite to store the job index
- Metadata from the job index is used where available for faster loading

BREAKING CHANGES:
- `Repository.find` now expects a query document instead of a list of tags

The repository format has not been changed, but the job index has to be rebuilt using
`r3 rebuild-index`.


## v0.3 (2024-03-28)
- Git dependencies are now automatically managed by R3
- Git dependencies do not require a `commit` key anymore. If not specified, the remote
  HEAD is used. Moreover, git dependencies might be specified by a branch or tag name.
- `find_dependents` has been added to the public API
- The commit timestamp is not stored in the job metadata anymore, but in the r3 config
  file.

BREAKING CHANGES:
- `Job.datetime` has been renamed to `Job.timestamp`
- The order of the constructor arguments for all dependency classes has been changed so
  that `destination` is always the first argument.

The repository format has been updated. Migrations scripts are provided in the
`migrations` directory.


## v0.2 (2024-03-18)
- Major refactoring of the code
- Major extension of the test suite
- CLI: Make `--repository` an option for all commands
- CLI: Remove `dev checkout` command
